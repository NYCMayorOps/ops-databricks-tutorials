    "Databricks invented Apache Spark. Spark is a framework from managing large datasets. The primary object in spark is a Spark DataFrame. This is similar to a dataframe in Pandas. However, Spark on the Databricks platform is much more than a way to manipulate dataframes. It also consistes of a storage system (delta tables in the catalog), workflows for executing code, notebooks for storing code, and much more. By doing data science in Spark Dataframes, you are able to write code optimized for the Databricks Lakehouse.  "

    "Sedona is a geospatial framework for Spark. It was originally created by Arizona State University in 2017, known as GeoSpark. Sedona is accessable through both Spark's SQL and Python language APIs, or any other Spark language like Scala, Java, or R.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary advantage of Sedona is that it is optimized for distributed databases like the Databricks Lakehouse and Snowflake. Using innovative indexing methods, it greatly speeds up geospatial processing, search, and retrieval. Apache claims it runs 2X-10X faster than other Spark-Based geospatial data systems, with 50% less peak memory consumption.This makes it an excellent choice for big data and very large datasets."
